/**
 * This test suit validates the integration between all rendering modules, i.e. it runs the entire
 * rendering process and expect the tree passed as a parameter to be rendered.
 * 
 * The tree we use here is created in the file 'integration.mock'. Its three stages (original,
 * pre-processed and ready to render) have been manually created and the goal here is to verify if
 * the rendering process can take the original tree and modify it into the two next stages.
 * 
 * The tree we created to make this test has missing ids, custom children properties, nulls,
 * pre-fetches, context, actions and expressions. This is so we can guarantee that the handlers for
 * every feature are being correctly called.
