  /**
   * Renders according to a template manager and a matrix of contexts.
   *
   * Each line in the matrix of contexts represents an iteration and each column represents the value
   * of a template variable. For instance, imagine a template with the variables `@{name}`, `@{sex}`
   * and `@{address}`. Now suppose we want to render three different entries with this template.
   * Here's a context matrix that could be used for this example:
   *
   * [
   *   [{ id: 'name', value: 'John' }, { id: 'sex', value: 'M' }, { id: 'address', value: { street: '42 Avenue', number: '256' } }],
   *   [{ id: 'name', value: 'Sue' }, { id: 'sex', value: 'F' }, { id: 'address', value: { street: 'St Monica St', number: '85' } }],
   *   [{ id: 'name', value: 'Paul' }, { id: 'sex', value: 'M' }, { id: 'address', value: { street: 'Bv Kennedy', number: '877' } }],
   * ]
   *
   * Note that the parameter `contexts` adds to the context hierarchy that is already present in the
   * tree, it doesn't replace it, i.e. you can still use the contexts declared in the current tree.
   *
   * For each line of the context matrix, a template is chosen from the template manager according to
   * `case`, which is a boolean or a beagle expression that resolves to a boolean. When `case` is an
   * expression, it's resolved using the entire context of the current tree plus the contexts passed
   * in the parameter `contexts` corresponding to the current iteration. If no template attends the
   * condition the default template is used. If there's no default template, the iteration is skipped.
   *
   * After processing all items, the resulting tree is attached to the current tree at the node with
   * id `anchor` (passed as parameter).
   *
   * The component manager is an optional parameter and is used to modify the resulting component.
   * This can be very useful for managing ids, for instance. The component manager is a function that
   * receives the component generated and the index of the current iteration, returning the modified
   * component.
   *
   * @param templateManager templates used to render each line of the context matrix.
   * @param anchor the id of the node in the current tree to attach the new nodes to.
   * @param contexts matrix of contexts where each line represents an item to be rendered according to
   * the templateManager.
   * @param componentManager optional. When set, the template result goes through this function before
   * being finally rendered.
   * @param mode optional. when `viewTree` is just a new branch to be added to the tree, the mode must be
   * specified. It can be `append`, `prepend` or `replace`. The default value is `replace`
