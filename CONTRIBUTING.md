# Contributing to Beagle Web

Want to contribute to Beagle Web? There are a few things you need to know.

# Branch Organization

Submit all changes to `main` branch. Always base your work on the project's `main` branch, naming your new branch according to the following guide:

* `feature/branch-name` for new features
* `fix/branch-name` for fixing a bug

# Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-web-core/issues) for our public bugs. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

# Sending a Pull Request

Before sending us a pull request, please make sure the following is done:
1. Run yarn in the repository root
2. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes (yarn test)
4. Make sure your code lints (yarn lint)

## Pull request guidelines

Help us review your PRs more quickly by following these guidelines.
* Try not to touch a large number of files in a single PR if possible.
* Don't change whitespace or line wrapping in parts of a file you are not editing for other reasons. Make sure your text editor is not configured to automatically reformat the whole file when saving.
* Reviewers will check the staging site and contact you to fix eventual problems.
